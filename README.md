# Simple Interest Calculator

Welcome to the **Simple Interest Calculator**! This application allows you to calculate simple interest based on the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and the time period in years.

## Features
- **User-Friendly**: Easy input for principal, rate, and time.
- **Accurate Calculation**: Uses the formula `Simple Interest = (P * T * R) / 100`.
- **Efficient**: Provides instant results.

## How to Use
1. Enter the following values:
   - **P**: Principal amount (initial investment)
   - **T**: Time period in years
   - **R**: Annual rate of interest (as a percentage)
2. The calculator will output the **Simple Interest**.

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs:
| Parameter | Description                          |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `P`       | Principal amount (e.g., 1000)        |
| `T`       | Time period in years (e.g., 2)       |
| `R`       | Annual rate of interest (e.g., 5%)   |

### Output:
| Output           | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Simple Interest` | The calculated simple interest based on the inputs. |

## Example Usage
```
Principal (P): 1000
Time (T): 2 years
Rate of Interest (R): 5%

Simple Interest = (1000 * 2 * 5) / 100 = 100
```
In this example, the simple interest for an investment of $1000 at an annual rate of 5% over 2 years is $100.

## Formula Used
The simple interest is calculated using the formula:
```
Simple Interest = (P * T * R) / 100
```
Where:
- `P` is the principal amount.
- `T` is the time in years.
- `R` is the annual rate of interest.
